Muon Optimizer Reproduction

This module provides an implementation of the Muon Optimizer as described in the paper
"Muon Optimizer Accelerates Grokking" by Tveit et al. The optimizer is designed to
accelerate the grokking phenomenon in neural networks through spectral norm constraints,
orthogonalized gradient updates, and second-order information approximation.
